# BreezySLAM Transpiled to RavaTTT

This repository contains the RavaTTT implementation of the BreezySLAM project. BreezySLAM is a Python-based library for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which has been transpiled into Rava This Then That (RavaTTT).

## About RavaTTT

RavaTTT (Rava This Then That) is an advanced programming language combining Robotic Process Automation (RPA) with operator algebras. It is designed for dynamic persistence, sensor integration, and action automation.

## Project Structure

- `BreezySLAM.rava`: The main RavaTTT file containing the SLAM implementation.
- `ravattt/`: Folder containing the transpiled RavaTTT code.

## Key Features

- **Thread-Based Programming**: Encapsulates SLAM operations in a structured thread.
- **Sensor Integration**: Utilizes `LidarSensor` for laser scan data input.
- **Dynamic State Management**: Handles SLAM states such as initialization, updates, and map retrieval.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the `ravattt` folder and explore the RavaTTT code.

3. Deploy the RavaTTT code in a compatible environment.

## Example Code

Below is a snippet of the `BreezySLAM.rava` file:

```rava
thread "BreezySLAM" {
    namespace: "SLAMNamespace"

    senses {
        "LidarSensor": "captures laser scan data for SLAM"
    }

    actions {
        "InitializeSLAM" {
            requires: ["LidarSensor"]
        }
        "UpdateSLAM" {
            requires: ["LidarSensor"]
        }
        "RetrieveMap" {
            requires: ["LidarSensor"]
        }
    }

    events {
        "NewScanAvailable" {
            triggeredBy: "LidarSensor"
            action: "UpdateSLAM"
        }
    }

    state "SLAMProcess" {
        from: "Idle"
        to: "Mapping"
        actions: ["InitializeSLAM", "UpdateSLAM", "RetrieveMap"]
    }
}
```
